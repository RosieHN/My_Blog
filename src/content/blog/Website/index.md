Have you ever dreamed of creating your own website but felt overwhelmed by the cost, complexity, or coding? What if I told you that you can launch your own live website for just $1—even as a beginner? Let me walk you through how I did it by cloning my GitHub repository, deploying to Vercel, and connecting a custom domain from IONOS. Simple, fast, and beginner-friendly!

🧰 What You Need
- A GitHub account with your project code pushed.

- A Vercel account (free).

- A domain from IONOS (starts at just $1/year!).
## Step 1: Buy a $1 Domain from IONOS
- Go to IONOS domain search and look for a cheap domain (like .xyz, .site, .store).
- Register it—most cost just $1 for the first year.
## 🚀 Step 2: Clone repositories from Github
You don’t have to build a website from scratch. Instead, you can:
- Pick a GitHub template like:
    - Astro Blog Template
    - Minimal React Portfolio
    - VuePress Blog Starter

- Click “Use this template” → Create new repo under your GitHub account.
## 🚀 Step 3: Push Your Website Project to GitHub
If you’ve already customized the website to match your interests, make sure it’s pushed to GitHub:
- git init
- git add .
- git commit -m "Initial commit"
- git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
- git push -u origin main
## 🌐 Step 4: Deploy to Vercel (for Free!)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/import
2. Click “Import Git Repository”
3. Log in with GitHub and select your repo (e.g., My_Blog)
4. Vercel will auto-detect your framework (Astro) and install dependencies
5. Click “Deploy” and wait ⏳

Boom! Your website is live with a vercel.app domain.
## 🔁 Step 5: Connect IONOS Domain to Vercel
1. In Vercel, go to your project dashboard → Settings → Domains → Add.
2. Type your domain (e.g.,e.g., mycoolwebsite.xyz) and follow Vercel’s DNS instructions:
### 🔵 Add A Record:
- **Type**: A
- **Host**: @
- **Value**: Vercel's IP (provided)
### 🟢 Add CNAME Record (for www):
- **Type**: CNAME
- **Host**: www
- **Value**: cname.vercel-dns.com.

Go back to IONOS DNS Settings, add those records exactly as shown.

Wait a few minutes for DNS to propagate.

Your site will now work with your custom $1 domain!
## 🎉 Final Result
You now have a working, live website hosted on Vercel, using a professional-looking domain—all for just $1. No server management, no expensive hosting plans, no headache. 

Whether you're building a portfolio, blog, or business landing page, launching a website doesn’t have to be expensive or hard. With GitHub, Vercel, and IONOS, you can go live with your dream site in under an hour—and for just $1.
