“Why am I a dummy?” — No tech skills, no tech degrees, no professional work experience, and English as my second language — I think I’m not a smart person either. But here’s the thing: if I can do it, so can you.

What makes the WiCys scholarship my DREAM scholarship? I recently secured the WiCys Security Training Scholarship, which includes Sans SEC 275, 401, and 504 — some of the most valuable certifications in the field of cybersecurity, totaling a whopping 20,000$ in value. And that’s not all — I also received a conference scholarship in April for an event in US. This scholarship covers everything from a flight ticket to hotel accommodations, ect providing a fantastic opportunity to network with professionals and meet fellow WiCys members. It’s also a chance to connect with organizations that share my passion for cybersecurity.

What are my thoughts on WiCys? I feel grateful for discovering WiCys and becoming a part of the WiCys community. It is a powerful community for empowering women in the field of cybersecurity, like a sisterhood where women are encouraged and supported to pursue success in cybersecurity. Through WiCys, I believe that it opens up new opportunities, allowing me to explore a world of possibilities and discover my true potential in cybersecurity.
